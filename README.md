AssetLoader module for ZF2
==========================

Introduction
------------
BaconAssetLoader is a module for ZF2 to ease the loading of assets within
development from multiple modules. This is not meant for production, as it adds
quite a bit of overhead. For deployment this module supplies a CLI script to
compile all assets into the public directory of an application.

Usage
-----
To use the module, add it to your application config. After that you must add
a listener in the "Module.php" of those modules which contain public assets. A
very basic example, assuming your asset directory is called "public", looks like
this:

    use BaconAssetLoader\Asset\Collection as AssetCollection;
    use Zend\Mvc\MvcEvent;
    use Zend\EventManager\Event;

    â€¦

    public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $mvcEvent)
    {
        $sm = $mvcEvent->getApplication()->getServiceManager();
        $sm->get('BaconAssetLoader.AssetManager')->getEventManager()->attach(
            'collectAssetInformation',
            function(Event $event) {
                $event->getTarget()->addAssets(new AssetCollection(__DIR__ . '/public'));
            }
        );
    }

Publishing assets in your build
-------------------------------
When building your project, you likely want to publish all your assets into a
single directory later accessible by your web-server. To do this, simply make
the following call on your console:

    php public/index.php baconassetloader publish-assets public
