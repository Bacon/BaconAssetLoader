AssetLoader module for ZF2
==========================

Introduction
------------
BaconAssetLoader is a module for ZF2 to ease the loading of assets within
development from multiple modules. This is not meant for production, as it adds
quite a bit of overhead. For deployment this module supplies a CLI script to
compile all assets into the public directory of an application.

Usage
-----
To use the module, add it to your application config. After that you must add
a listener in the "Module.php" of those modules which contain public assets. A
very basic example, assuming your asset directory is called "public", looks like
this:

    use BaconAssetLoader\Asset\Collection as AssetCollection;

    â€¦

    public function init(Manager $moduleManager)
    {
        $events = StaticEventManager::getInstance();
        $events->attach('BaconAssetLoader\Asset\Manager', 'collectAssetInformation', function($event){           
            $event->getTarget()->addAssets(new AssetCollection(__DIR__ . '/public'));
        });
    }
